In my journey as a software engineer manager, I've witnessed the complexities of engineering resource planning firsthand. The challenges are multifaceted: managers must account for bank holidays, employee absences, holiday allowances, and sick leaves. Additionally, some team members split their time between management and individual contributions, further complicating the equation.

To address these pain points, I developed the Engineering Capacity Planner. This tool helps engineering managers calculate their team's capacity over a given date range, balancing current commitments with available resources. By factoring in all variables, it provides a clear picture of what your team can realistically achieve.

## The Problem
Resource planning in engineering is not as simple as just counting heads. The number of available workdays fluctuates due to:

- Bank Holidays: These vary by region and can significantly impact capacity.
- Absences and Sick Leaves: Unplanned or planned time off reduces availability.
- Holiday Allowances: Employees may have unused holiday time that needs to be scheduled.
- Mixed Roles: Some team members, such as engineering managers, might contribute only part-time to hands-on work, requiring an adjustment to their capacity.


## The Solution
The Engineering Capacity Planner considers all these factors, allowing you to:

- Track Absences: Ensure every absence is accounted for in your planning.
- Factor in Holidays: Include public and bank holidays for accurate capacity calculations.
- Adjust for Mixed Roles: Assign an "engineering factor" to employees who split their time between coding and other responsibilities.
- Calculate Capacity vs. Commitment: Quickly see the remaining capacity versus the planned work for any given time range.

## Why This Matters
Inaccurate capacity planning can lead to overcommitment, burnout, and missed deadlines. By using this tool, engineering managers can make data-driven decisions, ensuring their teams are neither overworked nor underutilized. This balance is critical for maintaining productivity and team morale.
