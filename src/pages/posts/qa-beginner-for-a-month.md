I have worked as a developer in QA for a month. In general it's good, a new position and a new environment (of course people in here are also very nice!). I would like to review what I have learned last two month and what could be important for us.

#### Orientation
The first thing to get started in a new company is to be familiar with the environment. I got a long page of new starter on my first day. Another important thing is to get introduced to colleagues.

In my opinion, **interpersonal relationship** is crucial in the company. Especially for QA, something it might be more important than your responsibility. Good relationships can 
smooth coordination of all aspects of the work.

#### Test cases
Since I don't have commercial experience in QA, my manager assigned a senior QA engineer to give me a tutorials, which is really helpful. I have learned to use [TestRails](http://www.gurock.com/testrail/) to create test cases. To use test cases through out the QA process makes I feel confident with my QA result.

#### Test automation
The team have built test automation for a year and achieved a great success. As a developer in QA, I can use my programming background to help in test automation. However, as a new starter point of view, our automation could be a little hard to pick up. The reasons are:

- Configuration files are located in different folders.
- All methods are loaded into memory at the beginning. Even they are not required.
- Have to learn all modules for a single spec.
- Methods are called by an irrelevant object.
- Too many unknown codes. No one knows why it's there.

Without admiration of their wonderful achievement, I just hope we can refactor the codebase structure at some point. I believe it's beneficial for all of us.

Not sure whether this post makes sense. But I will definite share my learning here, and hope can discuss with all `Hackers`. **NEVER STOP LEARNING**
